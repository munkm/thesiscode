# Thesis Code /examples/ directory 
This is where a few example scripts that I used to perform the analysis of my
dissertation work live. 

* `sample_analysis.py` is an analysis script that generates all of the figures
  and table variants that exist for a single problem. 
* `sample_study.py` is an example script that you can use to create a
  parametric study for a particular problem variant. 
* `runall.pbs` is a sample header for an advantg pbs script. It is used by
  `sample_study.py` to generate the ADVANTG hybrid runscript. 
* `runmcnp.pbs` is a sample header for an mcnp pbs script. It is used by
  `sample_study.py` to generate the MCNP runscript.
